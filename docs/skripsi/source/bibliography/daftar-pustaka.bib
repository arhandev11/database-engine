@article{Gyrdi2023,
   abstract = {The accelerating pace of application development requires more frequent database switching, as technological advancements demand agile adaptation. The increase in the volume of data and at the same time, the number of transactions has determined that some applications migrate from one database to another, especially from a relational database to a non-relational (NoSQL) alternative. In this transition phase, the coexistence of both databases becomes necessary. In addition, certain users choose to keep both databases permanently updated to exploit the individual strengths of each database in order to streamline operations. Existing solutions mainly focus on replication, failing to adequately address the management of synchronization between a relational and a non-relational (NoSQL) database. This paper proposes a practical IT approach to this problem and tests the feasibility of the proposed solution by developing an application that maintains the synchronization between a MySQL database as a relational database and MongoDB as a non-relational database. The performance and capabilities of the solution are analyzed to ensure data consistency and correctness. In addition, problems that arose during the development of the application are highlighted and solutions are proposed to solve them.},
